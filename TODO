- The current file in vim may contain a directory that doesn't exist. Need to
  check for this in all commands.
- Redo scratch buffer create/destroy. By recreating buffers instead of re-use
  the buffer numbers of a vim session increase making them unwieldy.
- Reopen changes files: need better checks for changed files on some commands
- Implement an easier way to push gerrit reviews to different branches
- In the diff window, hit "e" to edit the file being diffed at the offset of the diff under
  the cursor
- In the log window: add "zj" / "zk" shortcuts for jumping to the next / previous commit
- Revamp opening of stash buffers when already in a stash buffer
- Implement git merge
- Implement git stash for the current file or even git stash -i
x Modify s:FindStatusFile so that we don't pickup Untracked as allowing checkout
x Put current staged diffs into COMMIT_MSG
x Implement help in Glog window
x Implement diff between commits in git log window
x Cope with filenames with spaces in all commands
